## Introduction
This is a game in which the user has to flood the whole game board with one color in less than the allowed steps.

## How to Play
The starting point is the top left corner, and your goal is to flood the entire board to the same color. To begin flooding, click on any color that isn't the top left corner's color. Continue changing the color until all cells are flooded. In order to win, you must complete flooding without running out of moves. There is a timer to keep track of time elapsed.
